        <h3>1 INT -- CABIN -- NIGHT (1946) </h3>
        <ul class="act-one">
            <li>THE JURY, D.A. (O.S.): Mr. Dufresne, describe the confrontation you had with your wife the night she was murdered. </li>
            <li>ANDY: It was very bitter. She said she was glad I knew, that she hated all the sneaking around. She said she wanted a divorce in Reno.</li>
            <li>D.A. : What was your response?</li>
            <li>ANDY: I told her I would not grant one. </li>
            <li>D.A. : I'll see you in Hell before I see you in Reno. Those were the words you used, Mr. Dufresne, according to the testimony of your neighbors. </li>
            <li>D.A. : What happened after you and your wife argued? </li>
            <li>ANDY : She packed a bag and went to stay with Mr. Quentin. </li>
            <li>D.A. : Glenn Quentin. The golf pro at the Falmouth Hills Country Club. The man you had recently discovered was her lover. Did you follow her? </li>
            <li>ANDY : I went to a few bars first. Later, I decided to drive to Mr. Quentin's home and confront them. They weren't there...so I parked my car in the turnout...and waited. </li>
            <li>D.A. : With what intention? </li>
            <li>ANDY : I'm not sure. I was confused. Drunk. I think mostly I wanted to scare them. </li>
            <li>D.A. : You had a gun with you? </li>
            <a href="./moment-one.html">
                <li id="yes">ANDY : Yes. I did.</li>
            </a>
            <li>D.A. : When they arrived, you went up to the house and murdered them? </li>
            <li>ANDY : No. I was sobering up. I realized she wasn't worth it. I decided to let her have her quickie divorce. </li>
            <li>D.A. : Quickie divorce indeed. A .38 caliber divorce, wrapped in a handtowel to muffle the shots, isn't that what you mean? And then you shot her lover! </li>
            <li>ANDY : <span id="redbold">I did not.</span> I got back in the car and drove home to sleep it off. Along the way, I stopped and threw my gun into the Royal River. I feel I've been very clear on this point.
            </li>
            <li>D.A. : Yes, you have. Where I get hazy, though, is the part where the cleaning woman shows up the next morning and finds your wife and her lover in bed, riddled with .38 caliber bullets. Does that strike you as a fantastic coincidence, Mr.Dufresne,
                or is it just me? </li>
            <li>ANDY : Yes. It does. </li>
            <li>D.A. : I'm sorry, Mr. Dufresne, I don't think the jury heard that. </li>
            <li>ANDY : Yes. It does. </li>
            <li>D.A. : Does what? </li>
            <li>ANDY : Strike me as a fantastic coincidence. </li>
            <li>D.A.: On that, sir, we are in accord... </li>
            <li>D.A.: You claim you threw your gun into the Royal River before the murders took place. That's rather convenient. </li>
            <li>ANDY: It's the truth. </li>
            <li>D.A.: You recall Lt. Mincher's testimony? He and his men dragged that river for three days and nary a gun was found. So no comparison can be made between your gun and the bullets taken from the bloodstained corpses of the victims. That's also
                rather convenient, isn't it, Mr. Dufresne? </li>
            <li>ANDY: Since I am innocent of this crime, sir, I find it decidedly inconvenient the gun was never found.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <br> <br>
        <ul class="act-six">
            <h3>6 INT -- COURTROOM -- DAY (1946) 6 </h3>
            <li>D.A.: Ladies and gentlemen, you've heard all the evidence, you know all the facts. We have the accused at the scene of the crime. We have foot prints. Tire tracks. Bullets scattered on the ground which bear his fingerprints. A broken bourbon
                bottle, likewise with fingerprints. Most of all, we have a beautiful young woman and her lover lying dead in each other's arms. They had sinned. But was their crime so great as to merit a death sentence?
            </li>
            <li>D.A.: I suspect Mr. Dufresne's answer to that would be yes. I further suspect he carried out that sentence on the night of September 21st, this year of our Lord, 1946, by pumping four bullets into his wife and another four into Glenn Quentin.
                And while you think about that, think about this... </li>
            <li>D.A.: A revolver holds six bullets, not eight. I submit to you this was not a hot-blooded crime of passion! That could at least be understood, if not condoned. No, this was revenge of a much more brutal and cold-blooded nature. Consider! Four
                bullets per victim! Not six shots fired, but eight! That means he fired the gun empty...and then stopped to reload so he could shoot each of them again! An extra bullet per lover...right in the head. I'm done talking. You people are all
                decent, God-fearing Christian folk. You know what to do. </li>
        </ul>

            <h3>10 EXT -- EXERCISE YARD -- SHAWSHANK PRISON -- DUSK (1947) 10</h3>
            <li>RED (V.O.): There's a con like me in every prison in America, I guess. I'm the guy who can get it for you. Cigarettes, a bag of reefer if you're partial, a bottle of brandy to celebrate your kid's high school graduation. Damn near anything,
                within reason. </li>
            <li>RED (V.O.): Yes sir, I'm a regular Sears & Roebuck. </li>
            <li>RED (V.O.): So when Andy Dufresne came to me in 1949 and asked me to smuggle Rita Hayworth into the prison for him, I told him no problem. And it wasn't. </li>

        </ul>
        <br> <br>
        <ul class="act-thirteen">
            <h3>13 ON THE BLEACHERS 13</h3>
            <li>RED: There they are, boys. The Human Charm Bracelet. </li>
            <li>HEYWOOD: Never seen such a sorry-lookin' heap of maggot shit in my life. </li>
            <li>JIGGER: Comin' from you, Heywood, you being so pretty and all... </li>
            <li>FLOYD: Takin' bets today, Red? </li>
            <li>RED: Bear Catholic? Pope shit in the woods? Smokes or coin, bettor's choice. </li>
            <li>FLOYD: Smokes. Put me down for two. </li>
            <li>RED: High roller. Who's your horse? </li>
            <li>FLOYD: That gangly sack of shit, third from the front. He'll be the first. </li>
            <li>HEYWOOD: Bullshit. I'll take that action. </li>
            <li>ERNIE: Me too. </li>
            <li>HEYWOOD: You're out some smokes, son. Take my word. </li>
            <li>HEYWOOD: I say that chubby fat-ass...let's see...fifth from the front. Put me down for a quarter deck.
            </li>
            <li>RED: That's five cigarettes on Fat-Ass. Any takers? </li>
            <li>RED (V.O.): I must admit I didn't think much of Andy first time I laid eyes on him. He might'a been important on the outside, but in here he was just a little turd in prison grays. Looked like a stiff breeze could blow him over. That was my
                first impression of the man. </li>
            <li>SKEET: What say, Red? </li>
            <li>RED: <span id="fella">Little fella on the end. Definitely.</span> I stake half a pack. Any takers? </li>
            <li>SNOOZE: Rich bet. </li>
            <li>RED: C'mon, boys, who's gonna prove me wrong? </li>

            <h3>14 INT -- ADMITTING AREA -- DUSK (1947) 14</h3>
            <li>NORTON: This is Mr. Hadley, captain of the guard. I am Mr. Norton, the warden. You are sinners and scum, that's why they sent you to me. Rule number one: no blaspheming. I'll not have the Lord's name taken in vain in my prison. The other rules
                you'll figure out as you go along. Any questions? </li>
            <li>CON When do we eat? </li>
            <li>HADLEY: YOU EAT WHEN WE SAY YOU EAT! YOU PISS WHEN WE SAY YOU PISS! YOU SHIT WHEN WE SAY YOU SHIT! YOU SLEEP WHEN WE SAY YOU SLEEP! YOU MAGGOT- DICK MOTHERFUCKER! </li>
            <li>NORTON: Any other questions? I believe in two things. Discipline and the Bible. Here, you'll receive both. Put your faith in the Lord. Your ass belongs to me. Welcome to Shawshank. </li>
            <li>HADLEY: Off with them clothes! And I didn't say take all day doing it, did I? First man into the shower! Delouse that piece of shit! Next man in! </li>

            <h3>17 INT -- CELLBLOCK FIVE -- NIGHT (1947) 17</h3>
            <li>RED (V.O.): The first night's the toughest, no doubt about it. They march you in naked as the day you're born, fresh from a Bible reading, skin burning and half-blind from that delousing shit they throw on you...and when they put you in that
                cell, when those bars slam home, that's when you know it's for real. Old life blown away in the blink of an eye...a long cold season in hell stretching out ahead...nothing left but all the time in the world to think about it. Most new
                fish come close to madness the first night. Somebody always breaks down crying. Happens every time. The only question is, who's it gonna be? It's as good a thing to bet on as any, I guess. I had my money on Andy Dufresne... </li>

            <li>GUARD: That's lights out! Good night, ladies. </li>
            <li>RED (V.O.): I remember my first night. Seems a long time ago now. Red looms from the darkness, leans on the bars. Listens. Waits. From somewhere below comes faint, ghastly tittering.</li>
            <li>VARIOUS VOICES (O.S.): Fishee fishee fisheeee...You're gonna like it here, new fish. A whooole lot...Make you wish your daddies never dicked your mommies...You takin' this down, new fish? Gonna be a quiz later. Sshhh. Keep it down. The screws'll
                hear...Fishee fishee fisheeee... </li>

            <h3>36 EXT -- EXERCISE YARD -- DAY (1947) 36</h3>
            <li>ANDY: Hello. I'm Andy Dufresne. </li>
            <li>RED: The wife-killin' banker. </li>
            <li>ANDY: How do you know that? </li>
            <li>RED: I keep my ear to the ground. Why'd you do it? </li>
            <li>ANDY: I didn't, since you ask. </li>
            <li>HEYWOOD: Didn't do it! Lawyer fucked me! </li>
            <li>ANDY: What else have you heard? </li>
            <li>RED: People say you're a cold fish. They say you think your shit smells sweeter than ordinary. That true? </li>
            <li>ANDY: What do you think? </li>
            <li>RED: Ain't made up my mind yet. </li>
            <li>ANDY: I understand you're a man who knows how to get things. </li>
            <li>RED: I'm known to locate certain things from time to time. They seem to fall into my hands. Maybe it's 'cause I'm Irish. </li>
            <li>ANDY: I wonder if you could get me a rock-hammer? </li>
            <li>RED: What is it and why? </li>
            <li>ANDY: You make your customers' motives a part of your business? </li>
            <li>RED: If you wanted a toothbrush, I wouldn't ask questions. I'd just quote a price. A toothbrush, see, is a non-lethal sort of object. </li>
            <li>ANDY: Fair enough. A rock-hammer is about eight or nine inches long. Looks like a miniature pickaxe, with a small sharp pick on one end, and a blunt hammerhead on the other. It's for rocks. </li>
            <li>RED: Rocks. Quartz? </li>
            <li>ANDY: Quartz, sure. And look. Mica. Shale. Silted granite. There's some graded limestone, from when they cut this place out of the hill. </li>
            <li>RED: So? </li>
            <li>ANDY: I'm a rockhound. At least I was, in my old life. I'd like to be again, on a limited scale. </li>
            <li>RED: Yeah, that or maybe plant your toy in somebody's skull? </li>
            <li>ANDY: I have no enemies here. </li>
            <li>RED: No? Just wait. </li>
            <li>RED: Word gets around. The Sisters have taken a real shine to you, yes they have. Especially Bogs. </li>
            <li>ANDY: Tell me something. Would it help if I explained to them I'm not homosexual? </li>
            <li>RED: Neither are they. You have to be human first. They don't qualify. Bull queers take by force, that's all they want or understand. I'd grow eyes in the back of my head if I were you. </li>
            <li>ANDY: Thanks for the advice. </li>
            <li>RED: That comes free. But you understand my concern. </li>
            <li>ANDY If there's trouble, I doubt a rock- hammer will do me any good. </li>
            <li>RED Then I guess you wanna escape. Tunnel under the wall maybe? I miss the joke. What's so funny? </li>
            <li>ANDY You'll know when you see the rock- hammer. </li>
            <li>RED What's this item usually go for? </li>
            <li>ANDY Seven dollars in any rock and gem shop.</li>
            <li>RED My standard mark-up's twenty percent, but we're talkin' about a special object. Risk goes up, price goes up. Call it ten bucks even. </li>
            <li>ANDY Ten it is. </li>
            <li>RED I'll see what I can do. But it's a waste of money. </li>
            <li>ANDY Oh? </li>
            <li>RED Folks who run this place love surprise inspections. They turn a blind eye to some things, but not a gadget like that. They'll find it, and you'll lose it. Mention my name, we'll never do business again. Not for a pair of shoelaces or a
                stick of gum. </li>
            <li>ANDY I understand. Thank you, Mr...? </li>
            <li>RED Red. The name's Red. </li>
            <li>ANDY Red. I'm Andy. Pleasure doing business with you. They shake. Andy strolls off. Red watches him go.
            </li>
            <li>RED (V.O.) I could see why some of the boys took him for snobby. He had a quiet way about him, a walk and a talk that just wasn't normal around here. He strolled. like a man in a park without a care or worry. Like he had on an invisible coat
                that would shield him from this place. Yes, I think it would be fair to say I liked Andy from the start.

            <li>HADLEY: ...so this shithead lawyer calls long distance from Texas, and he says, Byron Hadley? I say, yeah. He says, sorry to inform you, but your brother just died. </li>
            <li>YOUNGBLOOD Damn, Byron. Sorry to hear that. </li>
            <li>HADLEY: I ain't. He was an asshole. Run off years ago, family ain't heard of him since. Figured him for dead anyway. So this lawyer prick says, your brother died a rich man. Oil wells and shit, close to a million bucks. Jesus, it's frigging
                incredible how lucky some assholes can get. </li>
            <li>TROUT: A million bucks? Jeez-Louise! You get any of that? </li>
            <li>HADLEY Thirty five thousand. That's what he left me. </li>
            <li>TROUT: Dollars? Holy shit, that's great! Like winnin' a lottery...ain't it? </li>
            <li>HADLEY: Dumbshit. What do you figger the government's gonna do to me? Take a big wet bite out of my ass, is what. </li>
            <li>TROUT: Oh. Hadn't thought of that. </li>
            <li>HADLEY: Maybe leave me enough to buy a new car with. Then what happens? You pay tax on the car. Repairs and maintenance. Goddamn kids pesterin' you to take 'em for a ride... </li>
            <li>MERT: And drive it, if they're old enough. </li>
            <li>HADLEY: That's right, wanting to drive it, wanting to learn on it, f'Chrissake! Then at the end of the year, if you figured the tax wrong, they make you pay out of your own pocket. Uncle Sam puts his hand in your shirt and squeezes your tit
                till it's purple. Always get the short end. That's a fact. Some brother. Shit. </li>

            <li>HEYWOOD: Oh God, he's gonna do it, he's gonna throw him off the roof... </li>
            <li>SNOOZE: Oh shit, oh fuck, oh Jesus... </li>
            <li>ANDY: Because if you do trust her, there's no reason in the world you can't keep every cent of that money. </li>
            <li>HADLEY: You better start making sense. </li>
            <li>ANDY: If you want to keep that money, all of it, just give it to your wife. See, the IRS allows you a one-time-only gift to your spouse. It's good up to sixty thousand dollars. </li>
            <li>HADLEY: Naw, that ain't right! Tax free? </li>
            <li>ANDY: Tax free. IRS can't touch one cent. </li>
            <li>HADLEY: You're the smart banker what shot his wife. Why should I believe a smart banker like you? So's I can wind up in here with you? </li>
            <li>ANDY: It's perfectly legal. Go ask the IRS, they'll say the same thing. Actually, I feel silly telling you all this. I'm sure you would have investigated the matter yourself. </li>
            <li>HADLEY: Fuckin'-A. I don't need no smart wife-killin' banker to show me where the bear shit in the buckwheat. </li>
            <li>ANDY: Of course not. But you will need somebody to set up the tax-free gift, and that'll cost you. A lawyer, for example... </li>
            <li>HADLEY: Ambulance-chaaing, highway-robbing cocksuckers! </li>
            <li>ANDY: ...or come to think of it, I suppose I could set it up for you. That would save you some money. I'll write down the forms you need, you can pick them up, and I'll prepare them for your signature...nearly free of charge. I'd only ask

                what I'm sayin'? 6 to 12 for armed burglary. Said he done hundreds of jobs. Hard to believe, high-strung as he was. Cut a loud fart, he'd go three feet in the air. Talked all the time, too, that's the other thing. Never shut up. Places
                he'd been, jobs he pulled, women he fucked. Even people he killed. People that gave him shit, that's how he put it. One night, like a joke, I say: "Yeah? Who'd you kill?" So he says...

            <li> BLATCH: ...I got me this job one time bussin' tables at a country club. So I could case all the big rich pricks that come in. I pick out this guy, go in one night and do his place. He wakes up and gives me shit. So I killed him. Him and the
                tasty bitch he was with. (starts laughing) That's the best part! She's fuckin' this prick, see, this golf pro, but she's married to some other guy! Some hotshot banker. He's the one they pinned it on! They got him down-Maine somewhere

                Buy some worthless old boat and fix it up like new. Take my guests out charter fishing. You know, a place like that, I'd need a man who can get things.

                sand. Wade in the water. Feel free.

                Promise me, Red. If you ever get out, find that spot. In the base of that wall you'll find a rock that has no earthly business in a Maine hayfield. A piece of black volcanic glass. You'll find something buried under it I want you to have.

            <li>RED: Things got different out here.
            </li>
            <li> P.O.: Tell me about it. Young punks protesting the war. You imagine? Even my own kid. Oughtta bust his fuckin' skull.

            </li>
            <li> RED (V.O.): All I do anymore is think of ways to break my parole.

            <li> RED (V.O.): Terrible thing, to live in fear. Brooks Hatlen knew it. Knew it all too well. All I want is to be back where things make sense. Where I won't have to be afraid all the time.
            </li>
            <li>RED (V.O.): Only one thing stops me. A promise I made to Andy.

            <li>ANDY (V.O.): Dear Red. If you're reading this, you've gotten out. And if you've come this far, maybe you're willing to come a little further. You remember the name of the town, don't you? I could use a good man to help me get my project on
                wheels. I'll keep an eye out for you and the chessboard ready. Remember, Red. Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies. I will be hoping that this letter finds you, and finds you well. Your friend. Andy.

            <li>RED (V.O.): Parole violation. I doubt they'll toss up any roadblocks for that. Not for an old crook like me.

            <li> RED (V.O.): I find I am so excited I can barely sit still or hold a thought in my head. I think it is the excitement only a free man can feel, a free man at the start of a long journey whose conclusion is uncertain... 297 THE BUS 297
            </li>
            <li> RED (V.O.): I hope I can make it across the border. I hope to see my friend and shake his hand. I hope the Pacific is as blue as it has been in my dreams. I hope.
