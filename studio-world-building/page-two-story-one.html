            Historically, pandemics have caused immense social upheaval, horrific death, and large-scale change. After the 1918 Spanish Flu crisis, governments around the globe adopted healthcare initiatives to ensure widespread access to medical assistance, public
            sanitation initiatives increased, and the United States even saw the implementation of public housing safety requirements, such as fire escapes and social distancing. Within 100 years after the Black Plague ended in Italy, Feudalism fell,
            social relationship to death changed, Catholicism’s influence declined and the Renaissance transformed art as we know it.

            The darkness that arrives with mass sickness forces those who survive to look at the remains of a society that once was, struggle against limitations from an old world, and adjust in transformational ways that allows for better life to flourish once more.

            Adam Mckay’s new Netflix movie Don’t Look Up provides a timely, unique allegory that highlights the deadliest pandemic we are forcefully inundated with today: capitalism. After astronomy professor Dr. Mindy and PhD candidate Kate Dibiasky, played by Leonardo
            DiCaprio and Jennifer Lawrence respectively, discover an extinction-level sized comet hurtling towards Earth, the film explores how society (fails to) cope and plan for this overwhelming impending doom. Public response to the film shows how
            our collective is lost in a capitalist darkness, subsumed by the way things are as opposed to evolving in ways that will allow the light to shine through. Many of us have more blindspots than we think, constantly “looking” in the wrong direction.

            Don’t Look Up has received a wide array of reactions and criticisms, some of the most frequent ones I’ve come across being: it’s only about how climate change is ending the world; the movie is patronizing to conservatives; and it lacks proper racial representation.
            I think many of these takes miss the overall point, in the same way that a lot of our present efforts to change society for the better — on ALL sides of the political spectrum — fail to dismantle the actual structural foundation of modern
            inequality.
        </p>
        <p>
            The film does not point fingers at democrats, republicans, white or Black folks, straights or queer folks, etc., it indicts capitalism as the superstructural system responsible for everyone’s problems. Don’t Look Up immerses the viewer in frustrating
            political and media chaos in the face of an undeniable crisis and perfectly highlights the ways in which we, on a daily basis, are unable to see the heart of our issues, as those in power purposely obfuscate the truth for their benefit. Rather
            than uplift the truth, capitalism works within the government, media sensationalism, unnecessary politicization, misinformation, classed ignorance and individual complicity to impede our ability to ‘look up’ and see the comet for what it is.
        </p>
        <p>
            For example, in the face of the comet, tech celebrity-billionaire Peter Ishwell and President Orlean deprioritize saving humanity. Their joint class position, political power, and personal relationship moves them to make policy decisions that center their
            own ephemeral interests, such as improving the President’s poll ratings for reelection and furthering capitalist profit through the monopolization of the raw materials from the comet at the expense of the Earth. The administration even creates
            polarizing campaigns/slogans (“don’t look up”) that abuse American political loyalty in order to perpetuate conflict that ensures their status and job security, benefiting from manufactured social division.
        </p>
        <p>
            Capitalism disrupts the government’s ability to accept the threat of the comet as true in the first place, with the Orlean Administration only trusting the science when it was confirmed by capitalist-approved Ivy League institutions rather than immediately
            listening to Dr. Mindy and Dibiasky. The media, also inundated by class bias and celebrity, only cares about what will bring more views and money, with news hosts choosing to “keep bad news light” instead of asking the hard questions or maintaining
            journalistic integrity.
