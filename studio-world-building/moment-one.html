                "You see, “Shawshank” is the Stephen King adaptation with the famously unwieldy title that famously flopped upon its initial release before famously becoming the revered classic it is today. And with the prison epic marking its 25th anniversary in September,
                it’s worth taking a look back at the saga of Andy Dufresne — the one truly innocent man in Shawshank Prison."

            <div class="comment" id="comment-2">Red bets on Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) to cry. Maybe it’s because he looks like he doesn’t belong. And he doesn’t, he’s an innocent man locked up for murder of his wife. Details of this unfortunate scenario are revealed overtime, but they
                take a backseat as Andy Dufresne’s reality slowly becomes what’s inside the walls of Shawshank rather than what’s going on outside. I like to think Red took his bet on Dufresne because he didn’t come off strong. But boy was he wrong. Not
                only does he not cry, Andy slowly but surely adapts to his new life in prison. Red’s narration proves a great tool to show how some prisoner’s views of Dufresne change over time for the better.</div> -->
